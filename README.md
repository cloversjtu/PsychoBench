# ðŸ§  PsychoBench Dataset (Partial Release)

## Overview
**PsychoBench** is a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the **psychological intelligence** of Large Language Models (LLMs).  
The dataset is inspired by the **U.S. National Counselor Examination (NCE)** â€” a professional licensure exam for counselors â€” and aims to assess whether LLMs possess the psychological knowledge and reasoning abilities required for counseling-related tasks.

This repository provides a **partial release** of the PsychoBench dataset.  
The **full dataset** will be publicly released after the acceptance of the associated research paper.
